# rustracking

`rustracking` is a personal project developed with the intent of learning Rust. I started working on it after having read [the Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and wanting to create a project in a (fun) topic I am familiar with.
It's final goal is to perform a simplified version of track reconstruction in particle physics experiments.
Everything should be implemented from scratch as much as possible, using only the standard library.

## Progress
Some of the things which will have to be implemented

- [x] Matrix
- [x] Module + IO
- [ ] Hits + IO
- [ ] Event generation
- [ ] Clustering
- [ ] Seeding
- [ ] Visual representation
